# Overview

PluginManager is a library that loads and manages plugins after a program has started.

This library supports:
-automatic plugin loading
-event dispatching
-configuration loading
-dependency checking

# Building
You will need to have ConfigurationUtil (https://github.com/MrObsidy/ConfigurationUtil/) available on classpath, otherwise Configuration loading does not work properly. Include both of them in your classpath.
