# Overview

PluginManager is a library that loads and manages plugins after a program has started.

This library supports: <br />
-automatic plugin loading <br />
-event dispatching <br />
-configuration loading <br />
-dependency checking <br />

# Building
You will need to have ConfigurationUtil (https://github.com/MrObsidy/ConfigurationUtil/) Version 1.1.0 (this is important, version 2.0.0 is not compatible...yet) available on classpath, otherwise Configuration loading does not work properly. Include both of them in your classpath.
